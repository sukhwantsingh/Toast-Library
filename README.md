To get a Git project into your build:

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

allprojects {

    repositories {
     maven {
             url 'https://jitpack.io' 
           }
    } 
}
  
Step 2. Add the dependency  

dependencies {
               implementation 'com.github.sukhwantsingh:Toast-Library:Tag'
             }
  
That's it! Happy Coding!
